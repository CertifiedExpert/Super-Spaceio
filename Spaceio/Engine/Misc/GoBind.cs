    /// instances of GameObjects instead of returning references to previous GameObjects after deserialization, the GameObject 
    /// fields stored are not bound to their GameObject instances in the engine. Without using GoBind, after deserialization, an example
    /// field "private GameObject gameObject = ..." would hold the reference to an identical instance of GameObject 
    /// separate from the one which is stored in the engine, causing any changes to the "gameObject" not to be reflected in the engine. 
    /// Instead, what can be done is to create a GoBind field ex. "private GoBind gameObject = ..." and access its "Val" property
    /// to get the always correct GameObject reference.
    /// 
    /// NOTE: before accessing "Val" property of GoBind, it must always be made sure that the GoBind is active by checking 
    /// if IsActive equals to true. A GoBind is not active when the referenced GameObject is unloaded, preventing making changes
    /// to an unloaded GameObject.
